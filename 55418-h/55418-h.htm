<h2>JIMMY DELANY, OR THE ASCENDANT IDEA.</h2>

<p>“A merry morning to Father Connellan! Well, I dare
north, south, east, and west, of our sweet county of Wexford,
to produce such another comfortable domicile as this of
your reverence; and the proof that it is so in every respect,
is, that master, man, dog, cat, cow, and horse, have the same
sleek sides and sleek looks. I wish I could say as much for
some of the poor parsons.” “Alack! alack!” sighed Father
Connellan in a lachrymose tone, “you speak of what we <em>were</em>
rather than what we <em>are</em>. Poor things! neither biped nor
quadruped <em>here</em> carries the same port as formerly. Now, how
can you speak of sleek sides and sleek cheeks to me?&mdash;to me?
Take another glance at me: fancy me with a pink jacket and
black cap, and am I not just the cut, weight, and girth for a
jockey? ‘Ah! what a falling off is <em>here</em>,’” pointing to a
paunch that he asserted, with serio-comic phiz, was lamentably
diminished.</p>

<p>“Oh, most lamentably!” cried I, entering into his humour.
“Bless me! what is the matter? Oh, thou <em>poor, poor</em> disciple
of holy mother church! black was the fast indeed that
hath reduced thee to this pickle!”</p>

<p>“<em>Black</em> it has been more than once, sure enough,” returned
the priest, laughing; “and as I am a christianable man, this
strict Lent has been for the sins and follies of <em>others</em>, and not
for my own. But you shall know all.” Then raising his
voice, he called, “Jimmy! Jimmy Delany!”</p>

<p>Thrice he shouted, and was still unanswered. “Ay,” continued
his reverence, shaking his head and turning up his
eyes, “this is the cut! Job’s boils and blisters were nothing
to this! I may call and call, and have nothing but the echo
of my own voice for my pains. Once more I’ll try, and if he
doesn’t come then”&mdash;&mdash; and, placing his mouth close to the
wall, he sang out, “Jimmy Delany!” so tremendously loud,
that the delinquent must have heard it at half a mile’s distance.
At this fourth summons, shuffling, lagging steps
faltered up the hall, the parlour door opened, and the anatomy
of a man presented itself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">So faint, so spiritless.</div>
<div class="verse">So dull, so dead in look, so woe begone.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While gazing on him, I thought that if such a man were to
“draw my curtains in the dead of night,” he need not cry
out “fire!” to appal me.</p>

<p>“Well, Misther Delany,” began Father Connellan, “since
you have condescended to appear&mdash;(why don’t you make
your obeisance, sirrah?&mdash;draw back your shovel foot, bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
forward your great mop-head, and bow to the lady&mdash;soh, that
will do)&mdash;be plaised to explain how and why I, your spiritual
pastor and lawful master, am reduced to half my natural dimensions,
‘clipt of my fair proportions.’ As some one
says”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But ere the priest could proceed with his quotation, I broke
in with an exclamation of amazement.</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> spectre&mdash;plump, grinning, mutton-headed Jimmy
Delany! who used to wish for a gold chain but long enough
to encircle the <em>disc</em> of his face twice, and it would be as long
as the chain of my lord mayor of Dublin? Impossible! No,
no! Reverend father, you may make me believe much; you
are a man of mystery and mirth, potent and pleasant; but
you will hardly bring me to believe that <em>that</em> shadow represents
my plump and good-humoured old acquaintance Jimmy
Delany.” “I have my doubts too,” said his reverence.</p>

<p>All this time the ghost-like subject of our observations
stood mute and motionless, gazing at me with lack-lustre
eyes, in which there was no beam of recognition. Indeed, he
seemed dubious of his own identity; for when I refused to
acknowledge him, he passed his hand deliberately and cautiously
over his face and person, much in the way a blind man
would do; and it was a considerable time before he ventured
to assert “that he <em>was</em> Jimmy Delany still&mdash;if not in flesh
and blood, at laist in skin and bone.”</p>

<p>“Alas! and has it come to this with thee, Jimmy? I recognise
thy voice, though somewhat tremulous and less stentorian
than of old, and I would fain inquire for what unheard
of crime has this severe penance been imposed upon thee?&mdash;the
direst that the dire church can inflict, it must have been!
Hast thou made a pilgrimage with <em>unboiled</em> peas in your
shoes, my poor, poor Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Speak, sirrah!” cried the priest.</p>

<p>“Must I tell the <em>thruth</em>, sur?” asked the spectre, reddening,
and scratching his head in a dilemma.</p>

<p>At this juncture I perceived that the person appealed to
could hardly command gravity to answer the important
query addressed to him, and, but that a fit of coughing came
to his aid, alas for the decorum of Father Connellan!</p>

<p>“You are a good boy, Jimmy,” said his reverence with becoming
sedateness, when the teasing cough had subsided;
“a very good boy to apply to me ere you answered a question
under circumstances which induce you to conceal the
truth if you could. But, my poor, poor fellow, as I have said
and thundered forth a hundred times from the pulpit, <span class="smcap">Truth</span>
<em>should</em> be spoken at all times, however painful to us; and it
is especially necessary on this occasion, as I perceive a something
like a fling at the discipline of our church; because,
forsooth, you have dwindled from a mould four to a farthing
candle! Tell the truth and shame the <em>devil</em>.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, with a desperate effort poor Jimmy proceeded
to inform me that the cause of all his woe and waste
of flesh was “Betsy Kelly, an’ the urchint”&mdash;&mdash; Here he
stuck fast, and I waited in vain for the finishing of the sentence.
I next looked to the merry priest for an explanation,
but I found that it was equally fruitless to expect one from
him <em>then</em>. He had fallen back in his chair, in a fit of (to me
inexplicable) laughter; and the confused Delany, still more
confounded, took the opportunity to escape from the room,
saying, as he retreated, “I’ll lave it all to his rivirince!&mdash;let
him tell what he will&mdash;I won’t deny it.” “A fair stage for a
fertile imagination, Father Connellan?” said I.</p>

<p>“Egad, there is no occasion for a fertile imagination in
<em>this</em> case,” he replied. “Too true it is that the drama of
every-day life surpasses that exhibited on the stage. Now, here
is my poor Jimmy&mdash;<em>fiddle-string</em> I may call him, because I
play upon him daily, and he is almost reduced to one. If an
actor ever so clever were to show off <em>his</em> blunders and absurdities
on the stage, he’d be pelted to a mummy, or hooted
into a coal-hole for the rest of his days, for attempting (mind)
to impose on a discerning public with an outrageous caricature
of nature.</p>

<p><em>Baithershin!</em> let them come to Father Connellan’s cabin
for a week, and I’ll promise them more amusement for <em>nothing</em>
than they could get at the theatre in a year, and pay
dearly for it. But the farce is drawing to a conclusion now.”</p>

<p>“<em>Farce</em>, call you it? My good sir, to look at poor Jimmy,
I should suppose he has been enacting a very deep tragedy
indeed, and that the bowl or dagger must end it.”</p>

<p>“Or a marl-hole, or his garters,” said his reverence laughing!
“But is it possible,” continued he, “that you have not
dived into the mystery yet? Is it possible that I, a poor secluded
priest, dead to the world these twenty years, minding
nothing but my breviary, the souls of my flock, the Pope’s
bulls, and&mdash;and an occasional beef-steak and glass of punch,
was up to the secret in a trice, while you, a gay member of
society, are still in the dark? What direful, by me unmentionable
disease, doth these four ugly, sinful capitals spell,
L, O, V, E?”</p>

<p>“Love!&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! So Jimmy, poor Jimmy, is a
lover! ‘Oh, Cupid, thou <em>urchint</em>,’ as thy woe-begone disciple
calls thee, thou wert not blind, but <em>blind-folded</em>; thou stolest
a peep, and the barbed dart that rankles in the heart of poor
Jimmy was directed with laughter-loving malice!
Pray tell me, reverend Father, was the heroine&mdash;for heroine
she must have been, to have achieved such a victory over
dullness&mdash;a living woman? or did she smite him through the
pages of a book? for I recollect his reading mania at one
time.”</p>

<p>“Arm yourself with the seven-fold fence of patience for
half an hour, and I shall tell you all I know of the matter.
But I must begin with the beginning, according to the method
of all story-tellers. Now, a pinch of Lundy, a preliminary
hem! and here goes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“About five years come Michaelmas, I buried my old house-keeper
Nell Gray&mdash;I was going to say with military honours,
for she was quite a <em>trooper</em> of a woman&mdash;but with the honours
due to a faithful deserving servant which she was, and a
treasure in a family, especially for dressing beef-steaks. But
as I saw even in her a good deal of the tricks of the sex (excuse
me), I was determined to have no more womenkind
about me. I therefore set about searching for a good, quiet
lad, who would be tractable enough to learn to do all the
ordinary work of the house; and my wishes being made
known to my flock, boys of all ages and sizes soon clustered
about me like sparrows round a wheat stack. Out of twenty-five
’cute-looking chaps, I chose our friend Jimmy Delany,
to the rapturous delight of his mother, a widow, who, as she
brought her precious son to me, with a shining Sunday face,
and a clean shirt&mdash;or at least a collar&mdash;assured me that though
‘her Jimmy was the laist taste slow at takin’ up the larnin’,
yit wanst he got a hoult ov it, it was he that would take the
hoult in airnest!’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said I, ‘he is slow, but sure; the very sort I
want. Your quick people forget as soon as they learn.’</p>

<p>Well, Jimmy entered on his service, and, egad, ere the
first day closed, I found that his mother had told truth to the
letter! He was ‘slow,’ sure enough, and it was equally true
that the hoult he took was a ‘hoult in airnest;’ but the pertinacious
‘hoult’ was a hold of any eatable that fell in his
way, for he was a furious eater&mdash;God bless us! By and
bye, I found out more of Jimmy’s perfections, and I lauded
my sagacity in having discovered and appropriated such a
treasure. ‘Happy old parish priest!’ ejaculated I in an ecstacy,
‘thou hast but one servitor in this teeming world, and
the head of that chosen attendant admits but of one isolated
idea for a time, which ‘idea,’ be it never so extravagant, rules
his brains, words, and actions, as certainly and despotically
as the moon rules the tides!’</p>

<p>Into that head, by dint of hammering at it day and night,
his mother had instilled the ‘idea’ that he was to renounce
his old habits, playmates, and plays, as surely as he was to
fling away his old clothes, and henceforth to think of nothing
but of being a faithful diligent man-of-all-works to his reverence
the priest. In fine, in words suited to his capacity, he
was told that he was to forget the idle gorsoon, and to put on
the sarvint boy. For a week this song was sung to him in a
variety of tones, without producing any other effect on Jimmy
than causing a grin. At last, ‘Ov <em>all</em> works, mother?’ quoth
he. ‘Bedad I thinks I’ll have somethin’ to do. Howsomdever,
since I <em>must</em> be a sarvint, why it’s best to begin.’ And
thenceforward he laid his whole soul to the task; and so earnest
and anxious was he, that in little more than three months he
could do a few things decently without having me perpetually
pinned to his tail, and in a year he went through the routine
of household affairs without a blunder, not one thought or
wish interfering with his business. Like the churning-horse
of my neighbour Giles, he plodded over the dull ground allotted
for him without grumbling, and without being conscious
that any other mode of life might produce equal happiness.
Happy being! contented, stolid Jimmy Delany!</p>

<p>Things were going on thus smoothly with master and man,
while the mother was inwardly and outwardly fretting. She
expected by this time that her boy was taking a short cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
towards being a learned man, if not a <em>janius</em> all out; and great
was her dismay when she heard the truth! So she comes to
me with her humble petition ‘that I would be plaised to enlighten
her gorsoon’s brains.’ ‘I fear that is what no <em>mortal</em>
can do,’ said I, ‘but I will do my best for him.’ Indeed, I
was attached to the creature, and I thought it my duty to endeavour
to stretch his capacity if I could; and, accordingly,
I bought a Primer, and set him to learn his letters. Oh! it
was the unfortunate moment that I did so! From that hour
the man has never been himself; the four walls of my quiet
house have been eternally frightened with strange sounds;
and I have never had a comfortable meal since. A new ‘idea’
displaced the old one:&mdash;‘he was no longer a <em>sarvint</em>, but a
<em>schollard</em>;’ business was nearly suspended; and when strong
custom, or my stronger reproofs, so far prevailed that he
could not help going over the most urgent of the household
employments, it was not with even-handed justice; for, let
the <em>left</em> hand be occupied as it might, the <em>right</em> was sure to
clutch <em>the book</em>; so that every day and every hour he might
be taken for a clumsy leaden personification of Knowledge
extending the volume to the uninitiated, till the strange sounds
issuing from the blubber lips destroyed the illusion.</p>

<p>These strange sounds were first heard when he had surmounted
the Alps of the alphabet, and attacked the A, B,
<em>abs</em>; and from morning till night I could obtain no reply to
any question I asked him, without having a string of <em>abs</em> and
<em>obs</em> tacked to it, till my brains and patience could scarce
bear the repetition. Soon after, still sailing away on the
stream of learning, that notable piece of literature the ‘Read-a-made-aisy’
got into his hands, of which he made such excellent
use, that in a few days he could append a sort of poetical
illustration to his replies, according as my queries were
shaped, and sometimes he let fly a squib at me through their
medium. I’ll give you a sample of our colloquies:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Ah, then, Jimmy, did you shoot any birds this morning?’</p>

<p>‘One big fella, sur, choke-full ov the currans,’ quoth Jimmy,
bringing in as chorus, ‘A was an archer that shot at a frog.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what shall we have for dinner to-day, Jimmy?’</p>

<p>‘<em>Mait</em> to be sure, sur&mdash;B was a butcher that kept a big dog.’</p>

<p>‘Right, Jimmy, well thought of! Down with you as fast
as you can to Doyle the butcher’s, and see what meat he has
got. I think our friend the <em>constable</em> will dine with me to-day.’</p>

<p>‘I will, sur,’ said Jimmy. ‘C was a captain all covered
with lace.’</p>

<p>‘And,’ continued I, ‘as my dinner won’t be very splendid,
and I’m sure to have it very vilely cooked, I’ll bring forth a
bottle or two of my <i lang="la">supernaculum</i>&mdash;the rale mountain dew.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sur,’ responds Jimmy. ‘D was a drunkard that
had a red face.’</p>

<p>There was a good hit of stupidity! By the staff of St Patrick,
the patron of drunkards, it was the keenest <em>cut</em> I ever
received in my life, and the innocence with which it was spoken
gave it double effect. I fairly blushed, and dropped
my face over my breast like a great bursting peony whose
stalk is too weak to support it. Ah! my friend, happy would
I have been to endure those little embarrassments&mdash;however
unbecoming for <em>me</em> to blush&mdash;did I foresee the losses, crosses,
confusions and contusions which followed in the train of this
comet, and which I might have expected, for I partly concur
in the old opinion that the fiery prodigies of the heavens prognosticate
dire disasters to man; and the eccentric course of
this ‘hairy star’ in this little world of mine called Ballygrish
was equally portentous. But hitherto he had kept within
bounds. So long as he believed himself the <em>schollard</em> and I
the <em>schoolmaster</em>, he conducted himself according to the belief;
and the most fault-finding teacher could not complain of
Jimmy’s want of diligence. Indeed, he rehearsed his lesson
much oftener than necessary, in season and out of season, in
bed and out of bed, and that in such a thundering tone, that
I told him his constant petition to ‘hear him his task’ was
unnecessary, as I always ‘heard’ him sufficiently well, though
stone walls were betwixt us. But once he became independent
of an instructor, once he was quit of my assistance, I do
assure you severe chastisement was frequently necessary to
restrain his lunacies, and I much wonder how his skull bore
the thumps and cracks which from day to day I was obliged
to inflict, in lieu of shaving and blistering, to moderate the
brain fever of the imagination&mdash;of ‘<em>the ascendant idea</em>.’</p>

<p>I put up with various annoyances and inconveniences with
admirable patience and temper, and which I shall not now
stop to particularize; but one affair I cannot pass over, as
it made a haul on my purse, and I’ll relate it.</p>

<p>Just about the time that he set up to study for himself, I
was much in want of a pair of new <em>inexpressibles</em>. My velveteens
were much the worse for wear, and I was determined
to have a bran-new pair for the ensuing Sunday. So I sent,
very thoughtlessly indeed, the said student Jimmy Delany
with an order to Bryan the tailor to get the requisite stuff at
a certain shop. Unfortunately I did not specify any particular
colour or material, thinking naturally that all the world
knew the colours and materials fitting for clergymen; but the
shopkeeper and tailor&mdash;neither very much wiser than my
messenger, I fancy&mdash;were quite astray, and in their dilemma
they applied to my man-of-all-works for information. Alas!
they knew little of poor Jimmy. They knew not that he was
then under the dominion of ‘one idea’&mdash;that he was a learned
<em>schollard</em>, and not a <em>sarvint</em>.</p>

<p>Now be it known to you that his then study was the Universal
Spelling Book (I believe he had it in his pocket at the
time), in which is the story of the town in danger of being
besieged. The mason, the currier, and the carpenter, give
their opinion as to the best method of fortifying it, and each,
of course, with an eye to self-interest. The mason recommends
stone, the carpenter oak, and the currier leather.</p>

<p>Well, at the instant of the shopkeeper’s and tailor’s deliberations
on my wearables, Jimmy stood at the shop-door,
staring up and down the street, as far as it was in his ken;
and when the tailor appealed to him to know ‘what sort of
inexpressibles did his masther ordher,’ honest Jimmy, thinking
but of the ‘town in danger of being besieged,’ answered in
the words of the currier, ‘take my word for it, there is <em>nothing
like leather</em>.’</p>

<p>‘Leather!’ echoed the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>‘Leather!’ screamed the tailor.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ repeated Jimmy decidedly, ‘there is nothing like
leather!’</p>

<p>Well! patience is a virtue. Were it not that the gentle
spirit had made my half-starved frame her tabernacle, I
should have been a tenant for Bedlam on the succeeding Saturday
night, when the rascal Bryan brought himself and his
green bag, with a sort of grin, into my parlour, and untying
it, shook out before my amazed eyes a dashing pair of&mdash;&mdash; you
shall hear <em>what</em>, presently.</p>

<p>‘They’re a very neat piece of work, Bryan,’ said I, examining them
without much interest, thinking they could not
possibly be for me; ‘they seem to be well seamed and stitched
for aught I know, and I only hope for <em>your</em> sake that they will
fit him for whom you have made them.’</p>

<p>‘I hope so too, sur,’ quoth the tailor, smirking complacently.
‘Be plaised to thry <em>them</em> on sur, an’ I’ll engage they’ll fit to
the peelin’ ov an ingin.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh, pooh,’ returned I, good humouredly, still in the dark,
‘what use in <em>my</em> trying them on? Indeed, if they had come in
my way thirty years ago, and the <em>red rogue</em> in full chase, I
wouldn’t say but I’d pop them on, priest or no priest; but
<em>now</em> there’s no use in talking about them. Hand me out the
<em>velvets</em>, and let me try <em>them</em> on.’</p>

<p>‘The <em>velvets</em>, yer rivirince?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, the <em>velvets</em>, Sir Tailor; and I hope those you bring
me now are roomier than the last pair.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, faix, sur,’ cried the fellow, still shaking the <em>unmentioned
unmentionables</em> at me, ‘<em>those</em> are roomy enough in all
conscience, for I thought as how you wouldn’t like them <em>quite</em>
to the skin.’ And there <em>he</em> stood, holding forth his wearables,
and expatiating in their praise; and there <em>I</em> stood expecting
my <em>velvets</em>&mdash;but in vain! I caught up the bag, and
turning it inside out, I found I had nothing more to expect&mdash;those
forbidden ones were for <em class="smcapuc">ME</em>!</p>

<p>‘What <em>colour</em> are these in day-light?’ asked I, in that still
calm that precedes the tempest.</p>

<p>‘An iligant yellow, sur!’ responded the stitcher with alacrity,
his countenance brightening with hope.</p>

<p>‘And thou vile fraction of a man!’ thundered I in full
storm, and darting a withering scowl that almost put the
little animal into the earth, ‘hast thou no more reverence for
thy church than that, to suit thy petty interests, thou wouldst
see thy venerable parish priest, of seventy-six, figure in a
<em>pair of yellow buckskin breeches</em>, like a huntsman or postilion?
Away with them, sirrah, or by the soul of your grandmother
in purgatory&mdash;where she shall stay those hundred years for
your assurance&mdash;these same breeches shall case your own diminutive
limbs to-morrow, and you placed upon the altar as
an exhibition, with <em>Tally-ho!</em> in capitals upon your back.
What a beautiful spectacle for the congregation!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon I had the dismayed stitcher upon his knees, deprecating
my wrath, and recounting the particulars I have already
related in explanation; ending with ‘my backward blessing
on Jimmy Delany!’ intending of course that all my ire should
fall upon the real delinquent. And so it would, but that there
is something in the very name ‘Jimmy Delany’ that invariably
mollifies me. I knew he did nothing out of malice or mischief,
but from the greatest simplicity; and when I demanded
to see the book he was then busy with, and his thumb marks
pointing to the ‘town in danger of being besieged,’ I was at
home in the matter at once. But I had to pay for the leather,
and the tailor for making the breeches, which I lost afterwards
at a game of backgammon with Squire Hooligan.</p>

<p>About a month afterwards, a nephew of mine, a midshipman,
came on a visit to me, bringing with him some volumes of
Cook’s Voyages. These books seemed to have a fascinating
charm for him, but it was nothing to the charm they had for
Misther Delany. It was downright idolatry&mdash;he knelt to
them, I believe&mdash;I know he slept with them, ate with them, and
drank with them, and finally became so incorporated with the
work&mdash;he was its hero! Yes! all the old ‘ruling passions’
were clean forgotten, and Captain Cook was lord of the ascendant.
Oh! how the young seaman laughed, and roared,
and flung himself on the ground again and again, in ecstacies
of mirth, when he discovered what a jewel of a shipmate
Providence had provided for him in an old priest’s house in
the country, where he had expected little but long faces and
long fasts!&mdash;how he kicked up his heels in all the obstreperousness
of a sailor’s joy! Still the ludicrous perfections of
my poor Jimmy unfolded themselves&mdash;still his matchless simplicity,
his inconceivable infatuation under the dominion of
the new ‘idea,’ became apparent! And no wonder; for surely
his wholesale assumption of the renowned navigator, his
pompous action, and conversations <em>in character</em>, and the total
and absolute oblivion of all former ties and duties, altogether
were enough to raise laughter under the ribs of Death, and
was almost too much for the living. If I asked him, after
several hours’ daily absences, where he had been, his prompt
reply would be, ‘<em>at New Zealand</em>,’ or ‘<em>Otaheite</em>.’ And if I
begged to know what he had been doing in these favoured
places, I was instantly told, ‘getting in a supply of fresh
water and provisions for the ship’s company,’ and this with an
earnestness of look and manner absolutely irresistible. ‘So,
so,’ I would then say, convinced of the infatuation, and letting
things take their course, ‘I perceive I have got the illustrious
Captain Cook in my house. I thought the great man had
disappeared from earth long ago: but in this age of miracles,
either through the power of steam, or a galvanic battery, here
he is again, and I must make his stay as agreeable as possible.
Pray be seated, captain; and if not too much trouble,
I would be delighted to hear some of your adventures.’</p>

<p>Down would Jimmy seat himself, and out would come a
fluent description of the different places he had ‘touched at,’
the customs and manners of the different islands, the ferocious
looks of some savages, and the gentle countenances of others;
the birds, beasts, fruits, flowers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and I do declare
to you I desired no higher entertainment. For whole hours
would I sit listening to him; and the captain, gratified by my
attention, and utterly unconscious of anything ludicrous, continued
from day to day to pour forth his wonderful discoveries
for my amusement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I missed a fine bathing-tub, a fine spacious fellow,
in which I could float as comfortably as in a little lake.
I made various inquiries about it, but could hear nothing of it.
I even spoke of it in the chapel, but all to no purpose. However,
one day as I was returning from seeing a sick person,
I came upon an unfrequented path that led by the side of a
large and deep marl-hole, about half a mile from my house;
and as I got on a height over it, what should I see but my
bathing-tub floating majestically on the water, a pole stuck up
in the middle, with a red handkerchief by way of a flag, and a
person seated at one end with another pole for steering! With
half an eye I saw who it was, and I took measures accordingly.
I alighted from my horse, and, getting behind a clump of ash-trees,
quite unnoticed by the navigator, who was enjoying the
fineness of the day, I gathered up all the large stones I could
find into a heap beside me, and, taking deliberate aim, I let
fly two or three huge ones at the stern, in which the captain
was seated. At the first assault he started, and looked about
in every direction, quite thunderstricken and alarmed; at the
second volley, as none of them had hit himself as yet, he
shouted in character, ‘The natives! the natives are upon us!’
and began to paddle with might and main for shore; but as
the stones flew thicker and faster, hopping off his head and
shoulders, whacking, banging, cracking at all sides of him,
he lost all self-command, dropped his oar, and finally, in
floundering about, and starting from one end to the other, in
his confusion to avoid the stones, the boat turned keel upwards,
and the captain disappeared to the bottom, yelling all
sorts of ‘murdher!’ And I can assure you, my gentleman
forgot all <em>ideas</em> but that <em>plain Jimmy Delany</em> was on the point
of being smothered, and no sailor with a shark in his wake
ever showed more dexterity. Nobly did he buffet and plunge,
and kick and puff for his life, till he got to dry land, where I
was ready to receive him.</p>

<p>‘Are you safe, captain?’ inquired I in a tone of much commiseration.</p>

<p>‘Och, masther jewel!’ quoth Jimmy ruefully, his teeth
chattering between fright and cold, ‘I never was so near
death in my life! I was well-nigh smothered between the eels
and the mud at the bottom of that curst marl-hole!’</p>

<p>‘Ah! my Jimmy,’ observed I pathetically, ‘we should never
meddle with unknown elements. See how uncertain is the life
of a sailor!&mdash;one moment floating majestically on the bosom
of the ocean, and the next at the bottom with the fishes.’</p>

<p>‘Thrue for ye, masther darlint!’ replied my man, <em>once
more my man</em>; and home I drove my man before me, covered
with mud, as if he was preparing a cast of his beautiful person;
and so efficacious were the stoning, the ducking, my
lecture, and the shouts of laughter his appearance raised
amongst the workmen and neighbours, that I had soon the pleasure
to see him return to his original ‘idea’ that he was ‘sarvint
man to the priest,’ and become undividedly attentive.</p>

<p>But I believe this life is to be one of change and crosses.
No sooner had I sat myself down with the hope of peace and
ease for the rest of my days, than there comes another, and
the greatest of all annoyances, the more so that it was totally
unexpected. No! I never dreamt that Jimmy Delany would
become <em>a lover</em>! and when I <em>did</em> become aware of the state of
affairs, I was as much a stricken deer as himself&mdash;paralyzed,
bewildered what to do or say under the circumstances.</p>

<p>I will not trouble you with a detail of the first symptoms I
observed, nor a description of the many outrageous blunders
he committed under the influence of this worst of all ‘ideas’
but one&mdash;and here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was on a Thursday: I had ordered a beef-steak for dinner.
You know it is my favourite dish, and that I am particular
to have it dressed to a turn. I had taught Jimmy the
art; but warned by late failures and mistakes, I called in one
of the neighbours’ wives to have an eye to Jimmy while dressing
dinner. Well, at the hour appointed the dinner smoked on
the table sure enough, and, tucking a napkin under my chin,
I sat down ‘richly to enjoy;’ when lo! a loud scream, or
rather yell, from the kitchen, startled me, and the next instant
in rushed Mrs Flanagan, with outstretched arms, apparently
panic-stricken.</p>

<p>‘Oh, holy Mary! did you ait any ov it yet, sir?’ she asked
in breathless haste.</p>

<p>‘Eat what?’ demanded I, surprised.</p>

<p>‘That thing in the dish,’ screamed she.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said I gruffly, and angry at the unseasonable interruption.</p>

<p>‘Nor never shall, plaise God,’ exclaimed she, striding over,
and advancing her profane hands to seize the dish, whilst I,
holding it with one hand, motioned her off with the other, as I
angrily desired her to leave the room, and leave me to my meal
in peace.</p>

<p>‘Never, by the hob!’ exclaimed the determined vixen; ‘I’ll
never quit till I get that thing in the dish; and here I’ll stay’&mdash;and
there she staid in audacious determination. My mind
began to misgive me that there was something the matter with
what I was so pertinaciously defending; so I raised the cover
of the dish. There lay a substance black as the ace of spades.
‘So, so!’ I began, ‘here is a fine morsel for a hungry man!&mdash;here’s
frying with a vengeance! Woman, woman!’ cried
I solemnly, and turning to my obtrusive companion with the
dignity of a man who had received a mortal affront, but who
yet hail some feeling of God-like charity&mdash;‘Woman, woman!
is there never to be any dependence on your sex? I am
wasted to a thread; I am worked to a skeleton; and I think
this carcase hath need of a little indulgence on one day out of
seven. I pay sixpence a pound for a tender, delicate rump-steak,
and I call you in to superintend the dressing of it, decidedly
telling you to have it done the colour of your own skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
and no darker (dark enough in all conscience). But here
it is now&mdash;neither Bedford-brown, Vandyke-brown, Adelaide-brown,
nor <em>Flanagan-brown</em>, but a sapless, fatless, cinder
<em>black</em>! Nevertheless, such is my resignation under
all trials, I shall endeavour to make a meal of it, if possible:
do you but leave me in peace&mdash;vanish!’ and I muttered some
words in Latin, and gave two or three figurative flourishes
with my hands, by way of letting her think I was performing
some important ceremony of the church, at which her absence
would be necessary. But she stuck fast.</p>

<p>‘Why, thin, indeed, sur,’ she persisted, ‘if you war to
praich Latin an’ Greek from this till mornin’, you’ll never
convart an ould black wisted stockin’ into a beef-staik!’</p>

<p>‘A what, woman, in the name of heaven!’</p>

<p>‘I said it, sur&mdash;a black wisted stockin’ into a beef-staik.’</p>

<p>I stuck my fork into the black substance plentifully covered
with onion and gravy. I held it up: it was long, and, like
Italy, shaped like a boot; and however it might appertain to
the leg, it had nothing whatever to do with the rump-steak I
had bought in the morning.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ sighs Mrs Flanagan sentimentally, ‘sitch things
comes ov love an’ larnin’! I was mendin’ a pair ov yer reverence’s
black stockins at the kitchen-table, where Jimmy was
dhressin’ the dinner. One of the workmen called me out in a
hurry, an’ I threw the stockin’ out of my hands upon the
table: it fell upon the dish. Jimmy turned his head about for
a minnit, and the dog snapped up the mait, an’ carried it off.
When Jimmy looked round agin, he seen a black thing lyin’
on the dish, an’ the crathur’s eyes, bein’ blinded with this same
love an’ larnin’, he pours the gravy on the top ov it, an’
carries it off to table. So there’s the explanation.’</p>

<p>I still held up the black stocking on the point of my fork: I
gazed on it in silence: but the blood was boiling in my veins,
and I was on the eve of righteously overwhelming all that had
animal life near me with a fearful burst of volcanic passion,
when my frenzied eye caught a glimpse of a face at the half-opened
door. It was a side-face: the mouth and chin had
dropped as if in death, the goggle eyes were fixed and upturned
in all the rigidity of despair&mdash;not drops, but streams of
perspiration ran down the pallid jaws: motion seemed annihilated,
the senses defunct; and one loud, angry word would
have been a cannon-ball through the heart of poor Jimmy, had
not Mercy or Momus tickled my risibilities at the critical
moment, and a long, loud burst of irrepressible laughter
closed the scene, and saved his life! At the first burst the
delinquent fell on his knees, clasped his hands together, and
looked imploringly at me, and in that humble posture remained
till I got breath to say ‘I forgive you.’</p>

<p>Now, my friend, tell me can flesh and blood, especially dedicated
to the service of the church, put up with such treatment
long? Impossible. In addition to my fastings and mortifications
on <em>principle</em>, is it not the deuce to be obliged to fast for folly?
I have played many a trick on Jimmy, but he is ever more
than even with me. I can get no good of him. But this
I am resolved on: come weal come woe, Jimmy Delany and
Betsy Kelly shall be man and wife on Monday next, and I
bespeak your company at the wedding.”</p>

<p>“Agreed; and I think, reverend Father, this is the very
best <em>idea</em> that has been struck out by you, or <span class="smcap">Jimmy Delany</span>.”</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE COMMON BADGER.</h2>

<p>Of all the animals with which man has become acquainted, and
over which he has succeeded in establishing his dominion, none
have had greater cause to deprecate his tyranny, and to exclaim,
had they the gift of speech, against his wanton barbarity,
than the unfortunate creature whose simple and unoffending
habits I have selected for the subject of the present paper.</p>

<p>With the appearance and form of this animal most of my
readers are doubtless tolerably acquainted, as it is a pretty
common inhabitant of this country, and would be still more
abundant, were not its numbers checked by that barbarous and
brutal amusement, badger-baiting, to which, despite the interference
of the laws, hundreds yearly fall victims. In general
appearance as well as internal structure the badger approximates
closely to the bear, and may, I think not unaptly,
be regarded as the existing representative of that once formidable
denizen of the wilds of our native land. Like the
bear, the badger walks upon his heels and his legs being very
short, and his hair remarkably thick and long, his belly appears
almost to touch the ground; a little observation is however
sufficient to show that it does not actually do so. He is
a nocturnal animal, that is to say, he sleeps during the day,
and at the approach of evening leaves his habitation in search
of food; yet nocturnal though his habits, and however closely
he may in that respect resemble the predacious tribes, the food
of the badger is of such a description that its appropriation
injures no one, but is on the contrary productive of great benefit
to the agriculturist, consisting as it does chiefly, if not
solely, of roots and reptiles, as frogs, worms, grubs, beetles,
&amp;c. The badger is as far as I have been able to discover,
monogamous, lives affectionately with his mate and little ones
in his secluded burrow, and in his deportment to them displays
feelings of ardent devotion and disinterested attachment which
many of this poor creature’s biped persecutors would do well
to imitate.</p>

<p>The common badger is about as large as a middle-sized dog,
from two feet to two feet and a half in length, exclusive of
the tail, and about a foot or fifteen inches high. He weighs
from twenty to thirty-five pounds, sometimes even more&mdash;I
saw a badger in Edinburgh about six years ago which weighed
forty-seven pounds; such a growth is however very rarely attained.
In coat the badger presents a remarkable peculiarity.
Among nearly all mammiferous animals the dorsal region of
the body is of a darker or deeper colour than the under parts,
or ventral region. The colour of the badger is on the contrary
greyish above and black underneath. The fur of the badger
is thick, rough, and by no means glossy; the skin, with the
hair on, is dressed and manufactured into pistol cases. The
skin of the head and face may be frequently seen forming the
“<em>sporran</em>” or purse which depends from the girdle of the Scottish
highlander; and the hairs of the tail are in great request
for the manufacture of paint and lather brushes. The badger
is an inhabitant of all the temperate parts of Europe and Asia.
In Great Britain and France it is scarcer, from the assiduity
with which it is hunted and destroyed. Doctor Richardson
has identified various new species in his account of the zoology
of the arctic regions. As the object of the present paper
is however a sketch of the European animal, I shall not notice
any other at present, but merely refer such of my friends as
may feel curious on the subject, to Doctor Richardson’s splendid
work entitled “Fauna Boreali Americana.”</p>

<p>In his internal conformation the badger presents two remarkable
features, namely, in the first place a peculiar formation
of jaws, which not merely enables him to retain a firm
hold of whatever object he seizes with his teeth, but absolutely
<em>lock</em> in such a manner, that he himself does not always possess
the power of instantaneously unclosing them; and, secondly,
a pouch or bag placed just below the tail, whence
exudes a thick and fetid substance. It is upon this that the
strong smell given forth by this animal depends.</p>

<p>I had once a badger in my own possession, and the study
of his habits afforded me much interest and gratification. He
was more than half grown when I obtained possession of him,
and I can assure my readers that the task of taming him
was no sinecure. The first agent I employed for effecting
his domestication was hunger. I kept him fasting for three
whole days, allowing him only a little water in his bowl, which
humanity would not suffer me to deny him. Starvation, however,
did not produce any immediate good effects, and the animal
remained as fierce and irreconcilable as ever. It would
but needlessly occupy the readers’ time were I minutely to recount
the process of taming him; let it suffice to refer them
to my late papers in this Journal on the taming of animals.
I followed the rules therein laid down, and I had the satisfaction
of finding them ultimately successful, after from six to
eight months of anxious care, enlivened occasionally by the
variety of a severe bite, a casualty for which every practical
zoologist must be prepared, and at which it would be ridiculous
for him to grumble. I have only to observe, that were
any one to present me with a hundred pounds for the mark of
every gash received by its teeth, of which the scars still remain
on my hands and legs, I should be tolerably rich.</p>

<p>After about eight months, however, he gave up his practice
of constantly biting when attempted to be handled, unless
under great provocation or excitement, and was not merely so
gentle as to be with safety indulged with partial liberty, but
would come and go when I called him or drove him from me,
would feed from my hand or mount upon my knee, and was,
moreover, soon afterwards entrusted with entire liberty without
any danger of his running away. He was a very cleanly
creature, carefully scraping into one end of his cage whatever
unpleasant matters might collect in it, and he always contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
as much as possible to keep his bed free of soil. Finding
him so remarkably cleanly, I used to let him out morning and
evening, on such days as my absence from home obliged me
to keep him in a state of confinement.</p>

<p>I did not of course give him his liberty all at once, but according
as he grew tame I used to let him out in a room or
enclosed yard, according to the state of the weather, for an
hour or two daily, and did not give him his liberty altogether
until his increased tameness gave me confidence in his thorough
domestication. This creature’s diet consisted of bread and
milk, varied with oatmeal porridge or <em>stirabout</em>, and potatoes
boiled soft and bruised down fine with milk, with occasionally
a bit of raw butcher’s meat. He was singularly nice respecting
his meat; indeed I suspect rather from the effects of
good living in his easy state of captivity, than from an impulse
of nature; for had a piece of meat once, and that no matter
how slightly, known the fire, he would on no account touch it,
unless indeed when very hungry, and no raw flesh to be had.
Milk he appeared very fond of, and would drink freely; potatoes,
especially if mashed up with butter or milk, he would
always dine heartily off; but, which not a little surprised me,
I frequently observed him devouring them raw, and that too
in the absence of hunger, and while surrounded with what
might naturally be supposed to be more palatable food. He
had a very strong and by no means very agreeable smell.
I had an old terrier named “Wasp,” who had been a good dog
in his day, but, weighed down by a load of years, was fast hurrying
onward towards the grave. Wasp’s teeth had failed
him, his eyes had become dim, his clogged and tattered ears
scarcely informed him when I called his name, yet his fondness
for sport still remained, and he would lie for hours each
day at the door of the little yard in which the badger was
confined, as if resolved that, though his powers no longer admitted
of his discovering and attacking his enemy, yet he would,
while he could, inhale the (to him) delightful odour of his favourite
game.</p>

<p>My badger passed nearly the whole of his days in sleep, and if
I attempted to disturb him, he would be sulky and peevish, and
in no humour for play. When evening drew near, however, he
might be seen first stirring, then opening his eyes and stretching
himself, with many a long and hearty yawn. The process
of thoroughly awaking himself usually occupied about twenty
minutes, commencing with the decline of day, and terminating
with the arrival of darkness. The beginning of night usually
found him regularly astir; he was then restless and active,
pacing to and fro, examining every nook and cranny, climbing
upon everything upon which he was able to mount, and seizing,
if out of doors, upon worms, beetles, cockchafers, and
snails, and if within, seeking for drowsy flies upon the walls,
or for beetles or crickets about the kitchen hearth, or in the
cellars when he could obtain access to them.</p>

<p>Many naturalists hold the opinion that the badger sleeps
during the winter, or at all events hibernates partially, that
is to say, sleeps, like the squirrel, for a few weeks, awakes,
and takes a hearty meal of the store of food it had sagaciously
laid by in its nest ere retiring to winter quarters, and then,
coiling itself up in its nest, goes off to sleep again. Whether
this be true or not, I cannot with certainty affirm; but this I
can safely declare, that I endeavoured as much as possible to
make my badger hibernate, by exposing him to the unmitigated
cold of an unusually severe winter, by furnishing him with
straw and wool to line his nest, and with a stock of bread,
snails, and potatoes, to lay up for winter use. He did not,
however, avail himself of my assistance, but remained wakeful
as usual during the entire winter. A remarkable fact
worthy of notice here is, that although this badger exhibited
no inclination to hibernate or sleep during the winter, he did
display considerable disposition to aestivate, or sleep during
the hot months of summer, for during that season he became
languid and drowsy, lost his appetite and flesh, became ragged
and foul in the coat, and in short pined away so rapidly that
I feared I should lose him altogether; he however revived
completely as winter, and that a cold one, approached.</p>

<p>I made diligent inquiry of those who were in the habit of
keeping badgers for baiting them, and also of the proprietors
of several menageries, and learned from them that this disposition
on the part of the badger to become weak and lose its
condition in summer, is not confined to isolated individual cases,
but is common to the entire tribe.</p>

<p>It is truly astonishing to observe with what quickness and
dispatch the badger forms a burrow, for which task indeed
he is admirably adapted by nature, in the construction of his
anterior extremities. To give my readers some idea of these
powers, I shall conclude the present sketch with the following
anecdote of an individual in my possession:&mdash;Wishing
to increase the happiness of my pet, I procured a female
of his own species to keep him company, and while preparing
a large enclosure for their reception, I shut them
both up in an outhouse: I do not think I was half an hour
absent, when on my return I found my new badger gone. A
moment’s investigation discovered the place of her concealment:
the animal had during my short absence formed a
considerable burrow under the wall of the outhouse, which, I
must observe, was built against a bank forming the side of a
road. It was into that bank that the creature had worked its
way, and on listening I could hear it delving and scraping at
a great rate, about a yard from the back of the wall. I hastily
procured the assistance of a mason, who pulled down part of
the wall, and by working rapidly, succeeded in overtaking the
badger just as she had worked her way across the road to
within a foot of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden wall, beside
which I lived. I may observe that the ground was by no
means soft, the burrow being formed under a hard macadamised
road.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">EXTRAORDINARY DETECTION OF MURDER.</h2>

<h3>NO. III.</h3>

<p>Some fourteen years ago there was living in the city of Galway
a victualler named Hughes: he was not a Galwaygian by
birth, nor originally a victualler by trade; but having settled
there some years previously, and married a butcher’s daughter,
he entered into the business, and throve apace. At the time
we are now speaking of, there were few gentlemen in the
county of Galway with whom his word would not be sufficient
for a hundred pounds’ worth of cattle, and upwards; and the
man who was the envy of all his brother victuallers bore
strongly the apparent marks of prosperity, and a contented
mind in his florid, good-humoured, open countenance. So little
do appearances consort with character and circumstances at
times!</p>

<p>He was a kind husband and father, and reared his family
well and religiously; attending himself regularly to his devotions.
He was also a hospitable, off-handed fellow, that
would not higgle for a trifle, either in buying or selling; was
equally ready to take or “stand a treat” at fairs and markets
where his business frequently brought him, and was in consequence
a general favourite with high and low. In short, every
one said he was in the way of making a larger fortune than
had been made in his business for many a year in the city;
and every one said he deserved it, as he was an honest, a hard-working,
and a worthy man. There were apparently but
two drawbacks on his character, namely, a violent temper,
which at times hurried him on with irresistible impetuosity,
particularly when under the influence of liquor, and a habit
of jeering and jibing in season and out of season. These defects,
however, as they never led to anything serious, were
rather pitied than censured, as being the only blemishes on an
otherwise excellent disposition.</p>

<p>Hughes was standing one day at his stall, tapping his highly
polished boots with his whip, and feeling his well-filled pocket,
as he was preparing to set out on a journey for the purchase
of cattle. He was in high spirits, and was liberally scattering
about his jibing witticisms among his admiring brethren, when
a travelling basket-maker entered the shambles. Instantly
Hughes directed the current of his jeering towards the humble
newcomer.</p>

<p>“You look as if a good beef steak would lie in your way
this morning, friend.”</p>

<p>“Be goxty ye might sing that, sir, if ye had an air to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky there’s so many about you, any how, as, to
tell you the thruth, I don’t much like your looks, and wouldn’t
thrust yon with your own brogues to the brogue-maker’s.”</p>

<p>“Faix, may be you’d be right too, sir,” rejoined the stranger
slowly, as he surveyed, with an eager and a half bewildered
gaze, the jiber’s face, like one striving to recall portions of a
half-forgotten dream, “though it isn’t every one that’s to be
taken by his looks.”</p>

<p>“I wish, any way, I had as good a house as you’d rob. But
how come you to be trading in twigs? You mistook your
thrade surely; it’s in hemp you ought to be dealing.”</p>

<p>“Faix, if every man got his due,” said the basket-maker
in a decided tone, “more nor me would be dailin’ in himp.
But ye needn’t be so hard intirely on us, <em>Mr M’Cann</em>.”</p>

<p>On hearing this name, which had not met his ears for many
a year, the victualler gave a convulsive start as if he had
received a shot, while a fierce blaze deepened the hue of his
cheek, flitted across his brow, and the next moment subsided
into monumental paleness. He recovered himself, however,
immediately; and, remarking laughingly how curiously people
were often mistaken for others, took an opportunity of following
the basket-maker, who had advanced into the shambles,
and invited him to breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>Accordingly, punctual to the hour, the rambling mechanic
made his appearance at Hughes’s house, situated in one of
those archways characteristic of the Spanish built city, and
which strike the stranger so much in wandering through it
for the first time. The breakfast was excellent and ample;
and the basket-maker was received with great apparent cordiality
and welcome, and pressed immoderately to consider
himself at home, and partake plentifully of such fare as he
was seldom regaled with&mdash;a request with which he complied
to the utmost of his ability, notwithstanding that he discovered
his entertainer several times scanning him with an expression
of countenance he by no means liked. The breakfast over,
Hughes invited his guest to take a walk, stating that he would
show him part of the city; and accordingly they sallied forth
from the archway, which was off Shop-street, immediately
contiguous to the fine old church of St Nicholas, and within
pistol shot of the house over the door of which is inserted
the slab containing the far-famed death’s head and cross-bones.</p>

<p>“The Queen of Connaught” has been so often and so well
described, particularly by her own gifted son James Hardiman,
the distinguished antiquary, of whom she has such
just reason to be proud; and has, these late years, been so
much visited by tourists on their route to the wild territory
of mountain, bog, and lake, Connemara, during the touring
season, that her localities are generally known. Many of our
readers will then, at once, understand the direction taken by
the pair, and conceive Hughes’s probable motive for taking
<em>that</em>, when we state that he led his guest to the eminence on
the south-east side of the city, designated Fort-hill, which
terminates in a precipice lashed by the waves when the tide
is in, while scattered over its surface are several deep wells.</p>

<p>The victualler had made no allusion whatever, during the
breakfast, to the basket-maker’s having called him M’Cann,
nor to the county they both came from. As they went along,
however, he began to make some inquiries as if to sound his
companion. But the latter had become wary. In fact, as
they left the crowded parts of the town behind, fear began to
grow on him, on finding himself alone even in the day-light, and
adjoining a bustling city, with one whom <em>he</em> knew to be a
murderer; and that fear was strengthened by the manner of
Hughes, who sometimes strode on a few steps rapidly, as if
labouring under some excitement, and then halted to stammer
out some observation to his companion, while he occasionally
flung searching glances around, as if to ascertain who might
be in view. So, after having twice or thrice expressed his
wish to return to the city, on reaching the first of the wells,
the basket-maker refused to proceed any farther, and turned
to retrace his steps at an increased pace, though he did not
venture to run. Calling on him in vain to return, Hughes
now darted furiously after him with the intention of forcing
him back; but he was restrained by the sight of approaching
persons, and the basket-maker pursued his way back into
the city with a step quickened by fear, though he still durst
not run.</p>

<p>On regaining his humble lodgings the stranger lost no time
in repairing to the abode of the mayor, Mr Hardiman Burke
we think, an active, intelligent magistrate, to whom he accused
Hughes, or M’Cann as his real name was, of having perpetrated
a murder in the county of Down, eighteen years previously.
The charge was so extraordinary and so utterly at
variance with the peaceable, prosperous, and even humorous
habits of the accused, that the mayor at first utterly scouted
the tale, saving that the accuser must be completely mistaken
as to the identity of M’Cann. But the basket-maker was
so clear in his statement, recollected M’Cann so well while a
journeyman baker (his original trade) before the commission
of the murder, or his arrival in Galway, and was so intimately
acquainted with everything connected with him, that, in a
short time, after having detailed the morning’s proceedings,
he satisfied the mayor of the well-groundedness of the charge,
terrible as it was, and reluctant as he naturally was to believe
it; and the magistrate proceeded forthwith to act on
the information.</p>

<p>At that period the city of Galway containing probably nearly
forty thousand inhabitants, <em>some</em> of them certainly not among the
most peaceable in Ireland, did not possess even a single town
constable for the protection of its peace. Indeed, some years
subsequently, when we first visited it, it had no constabulary,
though that force had been for years appointed in every other
portion of the province, and was in consequence a peculiarly
lawless place; so much so, that it was quite a risk for
strangers or natives to venture abroad at all after dark, unless
in numbers, as, were you foolhardy enough to do so, some of
a gang of desperate and daring ruffians that infested the
streets by night, and traversed them openly in the day-light,
though branded with a hundred crimes, were sure to assault
you, and take your money, if you carried any, and if you did
not, to give you still worse usage for not having it. We
learned one night while passing the West Bridge, a favourite
haunt of those desperadoes, that the <em>brother of a priest</em> had
been just flung into the river there. Galway is now, however,
as efficiently protected and as well ordered as any town in her
majesty’s dominions, west of the Shannon at least.</p>

<p>The mayor’s first step, then, was to obtain a file of soldiers
whom he placed in his own house; after which he proceeded
at once to the shambles, where he found M’Cann after having
returned, not deeming, probably, that the basket-maker’s
informations would be so rapidly given. The victualler was
apparently engaged in his usual avocations, but as the mayor
watched him attentively for a few moments, his motions were
so irregular and so unlike his usual active, bustling habits, as
if he was labouring under some spell, that they utterly put to
flight any slight doubts the magistrate was still inclined to
entertain of his being the guilty person. Accordingly, he proceeded
to purchase a quarter of beef from M’Cann, whom he
begged to come at once to his house and cut it up there. To
this request M’Cann made some objections, stating that he
could not then conveniently spare time, but would send an
assistant: his reluctance arising probably from the connection
in his mind between the terrors of discovered guilt and the
mayor’s legal functions&mdash;of the latter’s having been made acquainted
with his secret crime he had not <em>then</em> the least conception.
After much persuasion, however, he assented, chiefly
through the clever cajolery of the mayor, who stated that
he never could get one to please him in cutting up beef but
M’Cann himself and he accordingly accompanied Mr Burke
to his house, on entering which he was instantly delivered
to the military stationed there.</p>

<p>He was forthwith transmitted to Downpatrick, and at the
ensuing assizes there, convicted of the murder of another
journeyman baker with a peel (an instrument used for placing
bread in the oven and drawing it when baked), eighteen years
previously. His death, it would appear, was a torturing one,
as the rope broke, and, previous to the consummation of his
terrible fate he was obliged to be strengthened with a draught
whilst seated on his coffin&mdash;this last receptacle of humanity being
frequently placed at the gallows foot during an execution.</p>

<p>The singular detection of M’Cann created a great sensation
from the extremity of the Claddagh to that of Bohermore.
Yet was it not more extraordinary than the blameless and
perseveringly industrious tenor of his life, and the apparently
utter want of all compunction after the perpetration
of the fearful deed; though these have been paralleled in numerous
instances, as well as in the celebrated one of Eugene
Aram; we allude to the real case, not to Bulwer’s magnificent
fiction. His striking and sudden abstraction from among
them, as if a thunderbolt had cleft him&mdash;though every thing
connected with him and his family has long since disappeared
from the city, forms still a frequent and exciting theme among
the Galwaygians, who invariably seem to be of opinion that
M’Cann’s object in leading the basket-maker to Fort-hill was
for the purpose of adding another murder to his crimes, by
pitching the stranger into a well, or hurling him over a precipice
into the sea. In this opinion we also fully coincide, as
we have little doubt that the murderer, but for the approach
of the chance visitors, would have attempted, at all risks,
to precipitate his companion into a well, where, entire stranger
as he was, he might have remained long undiscovered; or
to consign himself and his fearful secret for ever to those
faithful preservers of innumerable dark secrets, the waves.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE GEOLOGY OF KILLINEY.</h2>

<p>Few cities can boast of such a variety of beautiful scenery in
its immediate vicinity as occurs within a short distance from
Dublin. We need not allude to the objects of deep historical
interest with which the natural beauties of Dublin are associated,
as they have often been illustrated in these pages. The
picturesque beauties of Dublin Bay and the county of Wicklow
are known to all; but it is less generally known that
the same localities abound in matters well calculated to excite
the curiosity of the naturalist. From the great variety of
rocks, and consequently of soil, around Dublin, we find a corresponding
variety in its vegetable productions; and we believe
we are pretty correct when we state that the botanist may
collect specimens of nearly two-thirds of the indigenous plants
of Ireland within the distance of a few miles from the capital.
As regards Zoology, or the study of animals, our position is
equally fortunate. The shores near Malahide are uncommonly
rich in marine productions, especially shells; and the
Bay of Dublin is not inferior to the coasts of Devonshire for
the variety of its zoophytes and corallines. In the work of
Ellis on British Corallines, we find that, although that admirable
naturalist resided in London, he obtained many of his
finest specimens from Dublin. In respect to mineralogical
and geological pursuits, we are equally well situated. At
Killiney and in the mines of Wicklow several interesting and
some very rare minerals may be collected. In geology, in
the strict sense of the word, there are many curious phenomena
which should be repeatedly examined by the student,
and he will find such a mode of proceeding infinitely more
profitable than the more indolent method of confining his researches
to such instruction as can be found in books and
sections. At Howth, or the promontory of Bray, he may
examine every diversity of stratification, and may observe all
the upheavings and contortions to which rocks have been exposed,
displayed as in a model, open to the contemplation of
the man of science, and to the instruction of all. The granite
veins of Killiney are also extremely curious, and well deserve
to be repeatedly visited by the beginner in geological pursuits.
It is true that the questions to which such phenomena gave
rise have been long since set at rest; but it is also true
that the questions must be mastered by every student, and we
know of no place where this can be done to more advantage
than at Killiney.</p>

<p>Every one is aware that rocks are formed in two very different
ways, they may be produced either from the decayed
materials of older rocks, carried down to the sea or lakes by
the rivers, and subsequently consolidated by various processes,
which geologists have explained, or they may be formed by
the solidifying of liquid matter poured forth through some
volcanic aperture from the deeper parts of the earth. The
first kind of rocks are disposed in layers, beds, or strata, by
the return of water, and hence are called stratified, and also
aqueous or water-formed; the second, being liquid matters
which have become hard from cooling, are called igneous, or
fire-produced rocks. As volcanoes are at present confined to
particular regions of the earth, some may imagine that such
igneous rocks should only be found in volcanic regions. This,
however, is a mistaken supposition, for geology assures us
that igneous rocks are to be found in every mountain range.
The mode of reasoning which they follow is equally simple
and convincing. If we visit Howth, for example, we find
many of the strata resting on their edges, or variously
twisted. At the Killerys in the west of Ireland we find
strata composed of rolled pebbles, elevated to a very considerable
angle. It is impossible that strata of loose sand or gravel
would have been originally deposited in such inclined positions,
and we know of no natural power which would elevate them
but that of the igneous agency, producing either a violent
earthquake, or a long-continued upward pressure. This
opinion is much strengthened, when we find in every country,
whether volcanic or not, a series of rocks which appear to
have been violently inserted among the strata, and which we
can prove were once in a state of intense heat and fusion, like
the lavas from a modern volcano.</p>

<p>The granite of Killiney is one of those igneous rocks, and
the appearances which we detect in that interesting locality
afford satisfactory evidence of its mode of formation. When
we descend to the shore by the stairs, a little to the east of
the Obelisk, we find ourselves in a little way bounded by perpendicular
rocks. These rocks are of two kinds&mdash;granite,
and a schistoze or slaty rock, of a bluish colour, which we
may term mica-schist. We then observe that the mica-schist
rests on its edges, on a pavement of granite, and also reclines
against that rock. The junction of the two rocks may be
seen with the utmost perspicuity; and there is no blending
of their characters, even where they are in absolute contact.
We may next observe a ledge of rock partly covered by the
waves, and extending in nearly a north and south course
along the shore. This is a granite vein of many feet in
breadth, and several hundred yards in length, and may easily
be traced for a considerable distance. This granite vein is
bounded on both sides by mica-schist; and, what is still more
important, we may follow the vein till it is lost in the general
mass of granite of the hill. When we now remember that the
water-formed rock (the mica-schist) is standing on edge, a
suspicion arises that the granite is a fire-produced rock, and
has been the agent of this elevation, and the large wall of
granite may have been intruded in a molten state between
the beds of mica-schist. If it be objected that the granite
vein is merely a portion of the strata of mica-schist, and was
like them deposited from water, an inspection will dissipate
this illusion; for we observe that the great vein running parallel
to the strata gives off a smaller vein at right angles
to the direction of the strata. On examining this smaller vein,
which may be seen a little to the north of the stairs, all doubts
respecting its nature or origin are very soon removed. We
are surprised to find that this vein contains fragments of the
mica-schist. We may therefore conclude from this that
originally fissures were produced in the schist, and these
fissures were filled up by molten granite, which entangled
fragments of the mica-schist which fell from the sides of the
fissure. It is scarcely necessary to add, that we know of no
agent capable of melting granite but heat.</p>

<p>When we examine this interesting spot a little more minutely,
we detect many other granite veins, each affording some
curious and minute fact in harmony with the preceding remarks.
Every one knows that it is easier to split a piece of
wood in the direction of the grain, than transversely to that
direction. In the same way we may infer that it is easier for
a liquid granite to insinuate itself <em>between</em> the strata than to
force its way <em>across</em> them, and on examination we find this to
have been the case. In the first place, the large vein first
mentioned running in the course of the strata is broader than
all the transverse veins put together. Secondly, when we
examine the cross veins, we find they have had more difficulty
in forcing their way: hence they frequently contain fragments.
Perhaps, however, an examination at another point near the
entrance of the abandoned lead-mine affords the most curious
evidence of these remarks, for there we perceive that the vein
does not hold a straight course, nor is it of equal thickness
throughout, but, on the contrary, is of unequal breadth, and
serpentine, as if the strata had been violently lacerated instead
of being split. In this case the vein has cut across the strata,
and includes fragments of the mica-schist. But the most
curious circumstance in this example is, that the vein itself
has been broken, and its fractured extremities a little displaced
and detached, thus proving that the strata had been
exposed to concussion and displacement at a period posterior
to that when the vein was formed.</p>

<p>If this very brief description will induce any of our readers
to visit the granite veins of Killiney, we are sure he will find
that his excursion will not be an unimproving one, and he will
perhaps be convinced that he has only to look about him to
find sources of enjoyment which so many are ignorant of, but
which are within the command of all.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
